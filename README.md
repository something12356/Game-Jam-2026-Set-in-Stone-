## Ideas:

- Move about in 2D world in video game
- Encounters done physically
- Multiplayer, each player controls a character
- Can fight against each other or work together / team against other players
- Have to explore the (physical) board to unlock ores and stuff for their factory
- Labyrinth / cave sort of thing
	- Certain areas will *set in stone* and become inaccessible throughout the game
	- Tar, cement, quicksand, avalanches, floods etc
	- Once everything is sealed, game ends
- Factorio sort of idea - players can create contracts with each other, *LESS LOGISTICS*
- Points based on how many contract fulfilled / failed at end of game
- Turn based exploration *and* ore production?
- Limited amount of contracts you can accept? 
- Contracts should be on the screen, can see progress etc
- Can intentionally fail a contract early to lose less points than if it was at the end of the game, but that will keep the "contract slot" filled
- Contracts should look carved onto a stone wall or something
- Players will be dwarfs
- Enemies will be monsters, probably should have a gorgon and a balrog style thing, maybe have to fight dwayne the rock ... lol
- Combat areas with enemies blocking important stuff, players can work together to kill the monsters
	- Physically with dice, monster figures around the map
- 3-5 players?
