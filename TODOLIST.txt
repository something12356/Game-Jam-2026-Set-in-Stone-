We need a cap on the number of slots in a contract

We need a cap on the number of certain items to sell in contract

We need to add some logic to how proposing an extra slot works, as well as how the slots are dealt with

Probably need an indication for empty slots

Need some effect to show a contract being unfulfilled

Need to solve game board size logic

Find a way to integrate the music into the code (Or just play it in the background maybe but if can is better)

Tweak numbers with playtesting

Add a way to randomize starting resources

Need a way to show 'errors' e.g. if player doesn't have enough resources, or all machine slots full

Need proper turns not time-based but text-turn button
