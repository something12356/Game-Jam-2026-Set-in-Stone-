PLAYER HANDBOOK: THE INDUSTRIAL SURVIVAL PROTOCOL
This protocol governs the 120-turn extraction cycle (30 turns per player). Your objective is to accumulate the highest net worth through raw ore and rare gem sets. Strategy is asymmetrical: some start with wealth, others with capacity, and one with a target on their back.
________________________________________
I. THE LOADOUTS (CHOOSE ONE)
Each player randomly obtains a starting profile. 
Slots 11 and higher are "Safe Zones"—they are immune to debt-collection.
Set	Designation	Starting Inventory	Total Slots	Starting Building
A	Industrialist
19%	30 Iron 5 Copper	10	1 Iron Mine
B	Copper Baron
19%	95 Copper	10	1 Copper Mine Basic
C	Jumpstart
19%	15 Iron 5 Copper	10	1 Copper Mine Advanced
D	Architect
19%	0 Resources	12	1 Iron Mine
(2 Extra Slots)
E	Specialist
19%	10 Iron 33 Copper	11	1 Copper Mine Basic
(1 Extra Slot)
L	Lucky Winner
5%	The Gem Set*	10	None
The Gem Set: 1 Dragon Egg, 1 Ethiopian Fire Opal, 1 Yooperlite (Glow), 1 Elbaite. (The Balrog spawns at Turn 5 if Loadout L is in play).

II. THE TURN SEQUENCE
Actions must be performed in this exact order. Deviating from the sequence is a protocol violation.
1.	Phase 1: Specials: Use Elbaite (Heal 30), Secret Tunnel, Egg (Convert to other Special), or Fire Opal (Double building output).
2.	Phase 2: Attack: Only if near an enemy. Roll D10 x 10 for damage (0 to 90) 
3.	Phase 3: Hazards: Take damage from all applicable sources:
o	Balrog: Fixed 40 DMG.
o	Gorgon: 15 DMG + Petrify (Skip next turn. 1-turn cooldown applies).
o	Lava: 10 DMG (Occurs every turn you occupy a Lava tile).
4.	Phase 4: Movement: Roll D4. Move that many tiles.
5.	Phase 5: Logistics:
o	Contract Check: Fulfill due contracts or trigger the Debt Collector.
o	Production: All active mines produce ore.
o	Build/Trade: Construct mines or trade Empty Slots and Items. 
(Occupied slots cannot be traded).

III. THE RESOURCE ECONOMY
Buildings contribute 0 points to the final score. Only held ore and gems count.
Ore	Value (Score)	Building Cost	Production / Tick
Copper	5	Basic: 15C 
Advanced: 50C + 10I	Basic: 0.5 
Advanced: 2.5
Iron	12	40C	0.5
Titanium	300	100C + 50I	0.5
Tantalum	2000	50C + 50I + 10Ti	0.5

IV. DEBT & SLOT SOVEREIGNTY
Players may sign contracts to receive resources and fulfil them now or later. Failure to pay in the allotted time results in a Blocked Slot. Both sides have to agree for a contract to be set in stone.
•	The Debt Collector: If you have no empty slots (1–10), roll a D10. That building is destroyed and the slot is blocked.
•	The Safe Zone: Any slot numbered 11 or higher cannot be blocked or destroyed.
•	Universal Trading: Any player may trade empty slots to any other player. You cannot trade away your final slot; you must retain a minimum of 1. Trades can only occur through contracts and all contracts take up a slot and cannot be revoked, even on fail.

V. THE BEASTS & THE ENVIRONMENT
Entity	DMG	HP	Behavior / Effect
Balrog (Boss)	40	500	Moves via dice. 
Triggered if one of each special exists on players
or turn count.
Gorgon (Elite)	15	150	Petrify: Forces a turn skip. (Cannot stun-lock).
Lava (Env)	10	—	Deals 10 damage when stood on.

VI. SCORING & VICTORY
•	Gem Set Bonus: Completing a set (Egg, Opal, Glow, Elbaite) = 50,000 Points. Stackable
•	Death Protocol: If a player dies, they drop 50% of Special Items rounded down
(The minimum round down is 1) and they are out of the game.
